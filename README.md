I developed interest in programming world 3 years ago but
Was unable to get enrolled into one of the training platforms. 
Today I'm so grateful to have a great teacher in person of 
Mr. Adeshina who is ready to teach me with all his mind
So Python being one of the modern programming languages I will
Commit all my attention to learning and to mastering the course
So in the end I will become a solid software developer
